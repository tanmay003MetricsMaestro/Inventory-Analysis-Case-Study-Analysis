Project Overview
This project aims to analyze inventory data to gain insights into inventory management, identify trends, optimize stock levels, and improve decision-making processes. We will use Python, along with data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform this analysis.

Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Import and clean the inventory data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Descriptive Analysis: Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand the basic characteristics of the inventory data.
Trend Analysis: Identify and visualize trends in inventory levels, sales, and stock movements over time.
Optimization Analysis: Provide insights for optimizing inventory levels and reducing holding costs.
Reporting: Create comprehensive reports and dashboards to present the analysis findings

Conclusion
Summarize the insights gained from the analysis, discuss potential actions to optimize inventory management, and suggest areas for further research or improvement.
